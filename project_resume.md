# MongoDB RAG Agent

**Role:** Intelligent Knowledge Base Assistant
**Specialization:** Agentic RAG, Document Processing, Hybrid Search

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

*   **Languages:** Python (3.10+)
*   **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (Vector Search, Full-Text Search, Aggregation Pipelines)
*   **AI Frameworks:** Pydantic AI, OpenAI SDK, Transformers, Whisper (ASR)
*   **Document Processing:** Docling (PDF, Word, PPTX, Excel, HTML, Markdown), HybridChunker
*   **Tools & Utilities:** Rich (CLI/UI), UV (Package Management), Python-dotenv, Aiofiles
*   **Algorithms:** Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), Cosine Similarity

## 💼 Professional Experience

**Agentic RAG System Developer**
*   Designed and implemented a **Hybrid Search** engine combining semantic vector search (`$vectorSearch`) and full-text keyword search (`$search`) to maximize retrieval accuracy.
*   Engineered a **manual Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** algorithm to merge search results, enabling high-quality ranking on MongoDB Atlas free tier (M0).
*   Built a robust **Multi-Format Ingestion Pipeline** capable of processing complex documents (PDF, Office files) and transcribing audio using Whisper models.
*   Developed a **Conversational CLI** interface using `Rich`, featuring real-time streaming, tool call visibility, and aesthetic formatting.
*   Optimized system architecture for **asynchronous execution**, reducing query latency to ~300-600ms.

## 🎓 Key Capabilities

*   **Intelligent Retrieval:** Synthesizes information from diverse sources to provide accurate, context-aware answers.
*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintains document hierarchy and semantic boundaries during chunking for better context retention.
*   **Cost Efficiency:** Fully operational on free-tier infrastructure (M0 Atlas) without sacrificing performance.
